# angelbot
Automated AngelList job applier. A few gems have to be installed beforehand (capybara, drivers and drivers dependencies, maybe some others).

There is always room for improvement. I am still looking for possible changes


NOTE: after about 2^7 "I'm interested" hits, AngelList started displaying some messages along the lines of only applying for companies i am serious about. I have some workarounds in mind but I will wait until AngelList answers a few question I emailed about the situation.
